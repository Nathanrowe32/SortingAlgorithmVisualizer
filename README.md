 From there you can interact with the array by adjusting the sliders, the shuffle button, and by pressing any of the sorting buttons.

<h2> # Additional notes </h2>
Feel free to pull and play around, I made this project to experiment with sorting algorithms that I studied in Algorithms and Data Structures.
This project is currently utilising HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

Currently the merge sort, quick sort, and heapify do not have animations, but working on fixing it.
